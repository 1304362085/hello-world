最近想自己搞个mongoDB写个爬虫玩然而困难重重，现在把经验总结一下：
1.mongoDB在3.0以上就不支持32位系统跑了，而且配置的时候不可以用mongo:/里边的mongo:option，必须使用mongoClient和dbFactory来配置
需要加入：
http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/repository
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/repository/spring-repository-1.5.xsd
否则会解析错误。

2.关于jar包的问题，需要会报classNotFound
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/data/util/CloseableIterator
在StackOverflow上的大神给出答案：

CloseableIterator belongs to the Spring Data Core jar file.

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.data/spring-data-commons-core

Add this jar to your project if it cannot be found.

Edit:

Sorry posted the wrong link.

Have you tried the following jar file

http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.data/spring-data-commons

Hi Blairmeister, I have done that already. But this jar doesnot have the mentioned class file. 
spring-data-commons-core-1.4.0.RELEASE.jar – Rishi Jun 7 '16 at 10:10 
  	 	
I tried to change the jars as well – Rishi Jun 7 '16 at 16:37
  	 	
@Rishi You need to clean up your classpath. Remove spring-data-commons-core, org.springframework.data.core, 
and upgrade the version of spring-data-commons to 1.11.1.RELEASE. You maybe want to get rid of org.springframework.
transaction_3.0.5.RELEASE as all other Spring Framework artifacts refer to version 4.2.4.RELEASE. – mp911de Jun 8 '16 at 6:46
  	 	
@blairmeister point noted. I am on it now...Thanks for looking into it. I will update you in few minutes once done. Thanks again!

Hi @blairmeister That exception is resolved but new exception has occurred related to logger jar nested exception is 
org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException:
Could not autowire field: private org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate com.miet.kmpro.dao.UsersRepository.mongoTemplate; 
nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/Logger Kindly suggest the jar file to solve this problem with version. 
Also how did you manager to find the exact version of the commons jar. Thanks in advance for your help :-) – Rishi Jun 8 '16 at 8:24

Remaining problems were not related to CloseableIterator class 
and the main point to understand over here is that
whenever we are using the external jars we need to refer the latest stable release of the jars 
which has the required class files for which the NoClassDefinitionFoundException is thrown. 
Thanks a lot Stackoverflow for this nice forum!!

千万要注意这个，坑的头都疼
